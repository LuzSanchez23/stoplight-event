Part 1
Add DOM event listeners and handlers to toggle the on/off state of three bulbs.

When a user clicks on the "Stop" button, toggle the stop bulb's color.
When a user clicks on the "Slow" button, toggle the slow bulb's color.
When a user clicks on the "Go" button, toggle the go bulb's color.
TIP: All three bulbs can be on/off independently of one another.

Part 2
Add new DOM event listeners and handlers to log the mouse state of each button.

When a user's mouse enters a button, log "Entered <textContent> button" to the console.
When a user's mouse leaves a button, log "Left <textContent> button" to the console.
TIP: Each event type will need a separate event listener.
